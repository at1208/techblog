Hero missions defending cities against Talon agents.
Experience levels and customization options.
Multiple new heroes beyond Overwatch's original cast.
New maps and a new game mode called Push.

  <p className='e2'>OVERWATCH 2 NEW MAPS -</p>

  <p className='e3'>Kaplan said the game will run on a vastly upgraded engine, allowing for larger PvE maps and an updated look to the original game, which debuted in 2016. Some heroes will also see changes to their standard design .Kaplan likens the new designs to the various incarnations of Batman ‘the style may change, but the character will always be recognizable.’</p>
  <p className='e3'>A new cinematic introduced the sequel. Clearly the cinematic team does not believe in following the meta, as there were no Sigma or Orisa shields in sight. The cinematic also showed Echo. No official word yet on whether she will be playable in Overwatch and Overwatch
Overwatch recently came to Nintendo Switch.
