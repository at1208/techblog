  <p className='e3'>San Francisco based microblogging site, Twitter, removes animated PNG image files from its website after bullies have stolen the handle and hashtags of the Epilepsy Foundation to send potentially seizure-inducing pictures to epileptic and photo-sensitive people.</p>
  <p className='e3'>Twitter discovered a loophole that allowed users to override their autoplay settings and use the APNG file format to allow multiple animated images in one tweet.</p>

  <img src='../../../img/blog24one.png' className='e1'/>
  <p className='e3'>“We want everyone to have a safe experience on Twitter,” says the company in a Twitter Accessibility Handle tweet. “APNGs were fun, but they don’t respect autoplay settings, so we’re removing the ability to add them to Tweets. This is for the safety of people with sensitivity to motion and flashing imagery, including those with epilepsy.”
</p>
<p className='e3'>There will be no deletion of tweets with current APNG images from the website, but only GIFs will be able to animate images going forward.


</p>



<p className='e3'>How many people may have been affected by the attack is not clear, but the foundation said it cooperates with law enforcement officials and has lodged criminal complaints against accounts suspected to be involved.
</p>
<p className='e3'>Twitter said Monday, instead of APNGs, it would “look into building a similar feature that’s better for you and your Twitter experience.”
