  <p className='e3'>Xiaomi again set the competition of midrange devices to another level with the launch of Redmi K30 , after the great success of Redmi k20 devices . it is launched in two variant 4G and 5G in china. 5G device is limited for the china and other 5G ready nations, it will not launch in India but 4G variant is expected to launch on march 2020.
</p>




<p className='e3'>The Redmi k30 4G and k30 5G shares almost similar specs except some changes ,both the phones have 6.67 inch  punch hole 120Hz LCD panel with the resolution of 1080x2400 . the 4G variant comes with SD 730G processor which is excellent premium midrange processor and 5G variant comes with new SD765G which is the latest and greatest midrange 5G processor and this will become the first phone to use this.it comes with quad cameras 64MP Sony IMX 686 sensor which is beast in terms of performance  along with 8MP wide-angle and 2 MP depth and macro each. The phones comes with gorilla glass 5 (front and back) and huge 4500mAh battery along with 30 Watt fast charging (charger included in box).it is launched in different colour(Red,purple,white) and variant which include 6/64GB, 6/128GB, 8/128GB,8/256GB(  all storages are UFS 2.1).
</p>


<p className='e3'>As Xiaomi does not provide oled panel which exclude the Indisplay fingerprint scanner ,hence the fingerprint sensor is provided in the power button itself which is bit weird location. All the important sensor are included along with headphone jack and IR blaster. The Chinese pricing of the 4G base variant is 1699 CNY (17100 INR) and for k30 5G base variant is 1999 CNY (20000 INR). Indian pricing will be slightly more than this due to custom charges and other taxes  which is expected to be around 17999 INR for the 6/64 GB variant.
