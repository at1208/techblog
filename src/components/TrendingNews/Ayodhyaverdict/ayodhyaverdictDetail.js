<img src='../../../blog6.jpg' className='e1'/>
  <p className='e3'>Ayodhya Verdict Live Updates: Bringing down curtains on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue, one of the longest running title disputes in India, the Supreme Court has given the entire disputed 2.77-acre land to the Hindu parties with a trust to be formed by the Centre within three months to monitor the construction of a Ram Temple. The Sunni Waqf Board will be given 5 acres of alternate land, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court ruled in the unanimous verdict. The Nirmohi Akhara also suffered a setback with the court saying it is not a ‘shebait’ or devotee of the deity Ram Lalla. The CJI Ranjan Gogoi-led bench of Justices SA Bobde, DY Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer, said the Akhara's suit was barred by limitation.</p>

  <p className='e3'>The Ayodhya title suit verdict came nine years after the 2:1 judgment of the Allahabad High Court that ordered a three-way division of the disputed 2.77 acres of land between the three parties — Ram Lalla, Sunni Waqf Board and the Nirmohi Akhara. The Lucknow Bench had ruled that Hindus and Muslims would be joint title holders of the disputed land.

<p className='e3'>What is the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute?
Lord Rama was born in Ayodhya on the banks of the river Sarayu, according to the Ramayana. This place is identified with Ayodhya in present-day Uttar Pradesh. As per Hindu beliefs, an ancient temple stood at the birthplace to mark the spot. And that it was demolished in 1528 by first Mughal emperor Babur when he built a mosque - Babri Masjid - which was subsequently demolished by kar sevaks on December 6, 1992. Who reall .

<p className='e2'>Who are the main parties to the dispute?</p>
<p className='e3'>
There are three key litigants to the case. The Nirmohi Akhara which has been the shebait - manager of devasthan- of the Lord historically. The Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Wakf Board which administers all wakfs in UP. And the deity, Ram Lalla, which came into the litigation in 1989 through next best friend Deoki Nandan Agarwal, a former judge of the Allahabad High Court who later joined the VHP. Many community groups like the All India.

<p className='e2'>What is the legal history of the dispute?</p>
<p className='e3'>
In 1822, an official of the Faizabad court claimed that the mosques stood on the site of a temple. The court dismissed the suit.
In Dec 1949, some Hindu activists placed idols of Ram inside the disputed structure, leading to communal tension . The mosque was seized by authorities. Court orders restrained people from removing the idols, and the structure's use as a mosque effectively ceased from that point.

</p>
<p className='e2'>What did the 3 sides say in SC?</p>
 <p>
The Muslim side wants the masjid rebuilt at the same location. It also wants the SC to implement the Places of Worship Act 1991 which freezes all places of worship as they existed when India became free. This is to prevent spillovers to other disputed sites like Mathura and Kashi. The akhara and deity want possession of the land. The akhara is willing to concede the rights of the title to the deity if its shebait is recognised.
